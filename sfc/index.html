    Welcome to the new "new player" area for the San Francisco
    Resistance team.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ingress is a location-based game of capture-the-flag played on
    smartphones. We explore the real world around us, and compete
    over real landmarks against the other team.
    This competition, can be very active, social, and even
    educational! To succeed at Ingress, we have to interact in
    the real world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ingress can take you to many hidden places, neighborhood gems,
    interesting art, history, and landmarks; you can do this all on
    your own. However, Ingress is, at heart, a cooperative and social
    game. Your teammates will gladly help you become a stronger and
    smarter player. Reach out to them, and don't be surprised if we
    contact you via the in-game communications system if we see  a
    new player in the neighborhood. We want to see you succeed and
    have fun!
  </p>

  <h3>Contacting your teammates</h3>

  <p>
    The in-game COMM system is useful for contacting players when we
    don't have better ways to chat. It's the first thing you'll use.
    If you have questions, ask in the "Faction" tab of the COMM system.
    You can send (publicly visible) messages to specify players by
    long-pressing on their agent name, or by tagging them in your
    message with an '@' sign. That said, we don't use the in game
    COMM system for much, it's cumbersome and insecure. Once you
    reach your teammates through COMM, we'll help you get into the
    real chat areas.
