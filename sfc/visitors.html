    Welcome to the Visitor area for the San Francisco Resistance team.
  </p>

  <p>
    We're happy you're hear and would love to help you play with
    and meet our team.  If you're going to be here more than a
    couple of weeks, ask to be verified to join our Slack team.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have a Visitor's focused Google Hangout which you are welcome
    in, just ask to be invited by one of our administrators or mods.
    Contact them either through "the usual channels" or ping them
    in in-game COMM.
