  <p>
    Welcome to the Visitor area for the San Francisco Resistance team.
  </p>

  <p>
    We're happy you're here and would love to help you play with
    and meet our team. If you're new to Ingress, check out our
    <a href="index.html">new players</a> area.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have an invitation-only visitor-focused Google Hangout which
    you are welcome to join. If we know that there are active and
    interested visitors in town, we'll work with you there to
    coordinate builds, social events, and local knowledge, Ingress
    or not.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are already a resgistered agent on OneRing, you should
    check out the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://res.blue/group/san-francisco-visitors">
        San Francisco Visitor's group and telegram chat
    </a>
    there.  It's linked to the Visitor's hangout and you don't need
    an invitation to join us.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're going to be here for an extended stay, feel free to
    <a target="_blank" href="signup/">sign up</a>
